# Sketch Extractor

Makes white of an image transparent.

Converts the image to grayscale first, then draws all black pixels, but the lighter the pixels are the more transparent they are.

Ideal for extracting line art from a scanned drawing, so you can color it in with some other program...

Just upload an image and then use the download button to download the result.
